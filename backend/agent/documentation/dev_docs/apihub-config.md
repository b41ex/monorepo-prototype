# APIHUB Config
To add an ability to discover files different from supported specification format Apihub support special type of config.
It's called `Apihub config`, the format was inspired by swagger config and it's almost equals.
The only change is `type` field added.

## Paths
Default Apihub config discovery path is `/v3/api-docs/apihub-swagger-config`

## Schema
Base keys are
* "configUrl" - URL of the config itself
* "urls" - array of "url" objects.

"url" object contains the following fields:
* "url" - relative path to the file. Apihub agent will request the file by this path.
* "name" - human readable filename (short summary).
* "type" - one of the supported types.

Supported types:
* `openapi-3-1` — OpenAPI 3.1 specification
* `openapi-3-0` — OpenAPI 3.0 specification
* `openapi-2-0` — OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) specification
* `asyncapi-3-0` — AsyncAPI 3.0 specification
* `graphql` — GraphQL
* `introspection` — GraphQL introspection result
* `json-schema` — JSON Schema
* `markdown` — Markdown document
* `unknown` — any other file

## How to enable
steps:
1) add endpoint to the service with path `/v3/api-docs/apihub-swagger-config` or customized one
2) the endpoint should return the json as specified above
3) run discovery in Apihub agent and make sure that all required files are exposed
