## Revisions TTL

APIHUB backend implements an automatic cleanup mechanism for old package revisions to reduce migration size. The system
runs a scheduled job that removes revisions older than a configured time-to-live (TTL) period and meet the configured
conditions.

### Configuration

The revisions cleanup job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property                     | Default value | Description                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.revisions.ttlDays`                | `365`         | Number of days to keep revisions before they become eligible for deletion  |
| `cleanup.revisions.deleteLastRevision`     | `false`       | Whether to delete the last revision of a version even if it's the only one |
| `cleanup.revisions.deleteReleaseRevisions` | `false`       | Whether to delete revisions with "release" status                          |
| `cleanup.revisions.schedule`               | `0 21 * * 0`  | Cron schedule for the cleanup job (Sunday 9:00 PM by default)              |

The job timeout is automatically calculated based on the schedule interval to ensure it completes before the next run.

### How job works

The revisions cleanup job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Processes packages in batches, examining each version's revisions.
3. For each revision, checks:
    - If it's older than the TTL value
    - If it's the last revision (and whether deletion of last revisions is enabled)
    - If it has "release" status (and whether deletion of release revisions is enabled)
    - If it has any valid references from dashboards
4. Deletes eligible revisions and tracks the deletion in the activity log.
5. Cleans up related data like ad-hoc comparisons, default release version and previous version for other versions (in
   case of version deletion).

### Deletion modes

The cleanup job has different modes that can be configured:

#### Standard mode

By default (`REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_LAST_REVISION=false` and `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_RELEASE_REVISIONS=false`), the
job will delete revisions that are:

- Older than the configured TTL (default: 365 days)
- Not the last revision of a version
- Not in "release" status
- Not referenced by dashboards

#### Last Revision Cleanup mode

When `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_LAST_REVISION=true` and `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_RELEASE_REVISIONS=false`:

- Deletes revisions older than the TTL, including the last revision of a version
- Preserves revisions with "release" status
- Can completely remove versions if all revisions meet deletion criteria and none are releases
- Never deletes revisions referenced by dashboards

#### Release Revisions Cleanup mode

When `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_LAST_REVISION=false` and `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_RELEASE_REVISIONS=true`:

- Deletes revisions older than the TTL, including those with "release" status
- Preserves the last revision of each version
- Never deletes revisions referenced by dashboards

This should be used with caution as release revisions often represent important milestones.

#### Delete All mode

When both `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_LAST_REVISION=true` and `REVISIONS_CLEANUP_DELETE_RELEASE_REVISIONS=true`:

- Deletes any revision older than the TTL regardless of whether it's the last revision or has "release" status
- Can completely remove versions if all revisions meet deletion criteria
- Never deletes revisions referenced by dashboards

> **WARNING**: Delete All mode is not recommended for use with short TTL and should only be used with recent database
> backups. The job in this mode can potentially delete all published versions in the system if the TTL is too short.

## Ad-hoc comparisons TTL

APIHUB backend implements an automatic cleanup mechanism for version/operation comparisons to reduce database size and
migration size. The system runs a scheduled job that removes old and irrelevant comparisons, primarily focusing on "
ad-hoc" comparisons that are created for temporary analysis.

### Configuration

The comparisons cleanup job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property               | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.comparisons.ttlDays`        | `30`          | Number of days to keep ad-hoc comparisons before they become eligible for deletion                                                                                                                 |
| `cleanup.comparisons.schedule`       | `0 5 * * 0`   | Cron schedule for the cleanup job (Sunday 5:00 AM by default)                                                                                                                                      |
| `cleanup.comparisons.timeoutMinutes` | `360`         | Maximum execution time for the cleanup in minutes. After the timeout, the job will not be terminated immediately. 'VACUUM FULL' will be performed on the affected tables prior to job termination. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative. |

The job includes a vacuum phase that runs after the main cleanup to optimize affected database tables.

### How job works

The comparisons cleanup job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Iterates through all version comparisons in the system.
3. For each comparison, it checks for several deletion criteria. A comparison is deleted if any of the following are
   true:
    - It is an ad-hoc comparison older than the configured TTL. An ad-hoc comparison is one that was created between two
      arbitrary versions, not as part of a version's changelog.
    - It is an outdated changelog comparison, meaning it does not point to the latest revision of the previous version.
    - It is a comparison for a revision that no longer exists.
4. Deletes eligible version comparisons and related operation comparisons.
5. Performs VACUUM FULL on affected `version_comparison` and `operation_comparison` tables to optimize database size.

## Soft Deleted Data TTL

APIHUB backend implements an automatic cleanup mechanism for soft-deleted data to permanently remove data that has been
previously marked for deletion. The system runs a scheduled job that removes soft-deleted data older than a configured
time-to-live (TTL) period.

### Configuration

The soft deleted data cleanup job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property                   | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.softDeletedData.ttlDays`        | `730`         | Number of days to keep soft-deleted data before permanent deletion                                                                                                                                 |
| `cleanup.softDeletedData.schedule`       | `0 22 * * 5`  | Cron schedule for the cleanup job (Friday 10:00 PM by default)                                                                                                                                     |
| `cleanup.softDeletedData.timeoutMinutes` | `600`         | Maximum execution time for the cleanup in minutes. After the timeout, the job will not be terminated immediately. 'VACUUM FULL' will be performed on the affected tables prior to job termination. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative. |

### How job works

The soft deleted data cleanup job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Processes soft-deleted packages in batches, permanently deleting those older than the TTL.
   Deletes API keys and package transitions associated with packages. Any other data related to packages is removed via
   cascade deletion.
3. Processes soft-deleted package revisions in batches, permanently deleting those older than the TTL. Data related to
   revisions is removed via cascade deletion.
4. Performs VACUUM FULL on affected database tables to reclaim disk space and optimize performance.

### Affected Tables and Handling

The cleanup job affects the following database tables:

- **package_group** - package entities
- **published_version** - package revisions
- **activity_tracking** – related to `package_group`, but linked to a revision; however, these should not be deleted
  when a revision is deleted. Only remove records when deleting a package via cascade deletion.
- **apihub_api_keys** – remove the API keys that were issued for the packages being removed
- **build** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **build_depends** – related to `build`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **build_result** – related to `build`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **build_src** – related to `build`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **builder_notifications** – related to `build`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **favorite_packages** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **operation** – related to `published_version`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **operation_group** – related to `published_version`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion
- **grouped_operation** – related to `operation` and `operation_group` (many-to-many relationship), all related records
  are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **operation_group_history** – do not touch the records, as this table can be useful for analysis
- **operation_open_count** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion
- **package_export_config** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion
- **package_member_role** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion
- **package_service** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **package_transition** – has no relations, remove records that contain the packages being removed in the
  `new_package_id` column
- **published_document_open_count** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via
  cascade deletion
- **published_sources** – related to `published_version`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion
- **published_version_open_count** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via
  cascade deletion
- **published_version_reference** – related to `published_version`, all related records are automatically removed via
  cascade deletion
- **published_version_revision_content** – related to `published_version` and `published_data`, all related records are
  automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **published_version_validation** – related to `published_version`, all related records are automatically removed via
  cascade deletion
- **shared_url_info** – related to `package_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade deletion
- **transformed_content_data** – related to `operation_group`, all related records are automatically removed via cascade
  deletion

**Note**: cascade deletion is a database feature that automatically deletes related records in other tables when a
primary record is deleted.

## Unreferenced Data Cleanup

APIHUB backend implements an automatic cleanup mechanism for unreferenced data to reduce database size and improve
performance. The system runs a scheduled job that removes data that is no longer referenced by any active entities in
the system.

### Configuration

The unreferenced data cleanup job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property                       | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.unreferencedData.schedule`          | `0 15 * * 6`  | Cron schedule for the cleanup job (Saturday 3:00 PM by default)                                                                                                                                    |
| `cleanup.unreferencedData.timeoutMinutes`    | `360`         | Maximum execution time for the cleanup in minutes. After the timeout, the job will not be terminated immediately. 'VACUUM FULL' will be performed on the affected tables prior to job termination. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative. |

The job includes a vacuum phase that runs after the main cleanup to optimize affected database tables.

### How job works

The unreferenced data cleanup job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Processes and deletes unreferenced data in batches for each data type:
    - **Operation data** - removes `operation_data` records that are no longer referenced by any operation. Records in
   `ts_rest_operation_data`, `ts_graphql_operation_data`, `ts_operation_data` and `fts_operation_data` will be removed by cascade deletion.
    - **Operation group templates** - removes `operation_group_template` records that are no longer referenced by any operation group.
    - **Source archives** - removes `published_sources_archives` records that are no longer referenced by any published source.
    - **Published data** - removes `published_data` records that are no longer referenced by any published document.
3. Performs VACUUM FULL on affected database tables to reclaim disk space and optimize performance.

**Note**: Unlike other cleanup jobs, this job does not use a TTL (Time-To-Live) configuration. It removes all
unreferenced data regardless of age, as unreferenced data serves no purpose in the system.

## Builds Cleanup

APIHUB backend implements an automatic cleanup mechanism for build data to reduce database and S3 storage size. The
system runs a scheduled job that removes builds older than a fixed retention period: 1 week for successful builds and
30 days for failed ones. When S3 storage is enabled, the job also removes the build results of these builds from the
bucket, and deletes expired objects that no longer correspond to any build in the database.

### Configuration

The builds cleanup job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property                         | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.builds.schedule`                      | `0 1 * * 0`   | Cron schedule for the cleanup job (Sunday 1:00 AM by default)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `cleanup.builds.timeoutMinutes`                | `360`         | Maximum execution time for the removal of expired builds in minutes. After the timeout, the running database operations are cancelled. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative.                                                                                    |
| `cleanup.builds.expiredS3Files.timeoutMinutes` | `360`         | Maximum execution time for the expired S3 files phase in minutes. After the timeout, the sweep stops and resumes on the next run. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative.                                                                                         |

The expired S3 files phase runs only when S3 storage is enabled. The two timeouts are independent: the phase starts
after the expired builds are removed and counts its own timeout from that moment, even when
`cleanup.builds.timeoutMinutes` has already expired. The job therefore runs up to the sum of both values, which is 12
hours with the default settings. Take this into account when scheduling the job, so that it does not overlap with the
jobs that follow.

### How job works

The builds cleanup job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Checks the `build_cleanup_run` table - if the previous run happened within the current schedule interval, it skips
   execution.
3. With S3 storage disabled, deletes expired builds from `build_src` and `build_result`, then performs VACUUM FULL on
   both tables.
4. With S3 storage enabled, removes the build results of expired builds from the bucket, deletes the corresponding
   `build_src` records and performs VACUUM FULL on `build_src`.
5. With S3 storage enabled, runs the expired S3 files phase: walks the `build_result/` prefix in the bucket and removes
   every object older than 45 days, regardless of whether it is still referenced in the database. The threshold is a
   constant in the code, not a configuration property. It keeps a margin above the 30-day retention of failed builds,
   otherwise the sweep would remove files of builds that are still referenced. The sweep restarts from the beginning of
   the prefix on every run, as no progress is stored between runs.
6. Writes the results of the phase to the `build_cleanup_run` table, into the `expired_s3_files_count` and
   `expired_s3_files_details` columns.

## Maintenance Vacuum

APIHUB backend runs a dedicated scheduled maintenance vacuum job to execute `VACUUM FULL ANALYZE` for eligible
public tables. This job is independent from migration stages and should be scheduled during low-traffic windows
because it may lock tables.

### Configuration

The maintenance vacuum job is configured via configuration properties:

| Configuration property                      | Default value | Description                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cleanup.maintenanceVacuum.schedule`        | `0 2 * * 1`   | Cron schedule for maintenance vacuum job (Monday 2:00 AM by default)           |
| `cleanup.maintenanceVacuum.timeoutMinutes`  | `300`         | Maximum duration of maintenance vacuum phase (`VACUUM FULL ANALYZE`) in minutes. Must be greater than `0`. The service fails to start if the value is zero or negative. |

### How job works

The maintenance vacuum job performs the following steps:

1. Checks if any migrations are running - if so, it skips execution to avoid conflicts.
2. Fetches all public tables (via `pg_stat_all_tables`).
3. Executes `VACUUM FULL ANALYZE` for each eligible table.

## Cleanup Job Schedules

All cleanup jobs run on predefined schedules to avoid conflicts and distribute system load:

| Job type                   | Default schedule | Description          | Day/Time       | Cleanup phase timeout                                                                                              | Vacuum phase timeout                                      |

**Note**: when scheduling `Comparisons Cleanup`, `Soft Deleted Data Cleanup`, `Unreferenced Data Cleanup` and
`Builds Cleanup` jobs, it is important to keep in mind that each job consists of two phases: cleanup and vacuuming of
the affected tables. `Builds Cleanup` has a third phase, the expired S3 files sweep, when S3 storage is enabled. All
phases of a job should be completed before the next job starts in order to avoid excessive system load and database
table locks.
