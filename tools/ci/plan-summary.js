/**
 * Render the plan job's decision as a GitHub job summary.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DRAW
 *
 * The first version of this script drew the job graph — plan -> js -> screenshot-tests /
 * images -> ci-ok, coloured by run/skip. That was useless: GitHub already renders exactly
 * that in the run view, out of the box, with the same skip states. A summary that repeats
 * the surrounding UI costs a scroll and returns nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY INVISIBLE
 *
 * The Nx project graph. GitHub shows five jobs; it cannot show that `js` scheduled 15 tasks,
 * that 1 of them rebuilt and 14 were served from cache, or which upstreams those were. That
 * is where the run's cost comes from and none of it appears anywhere else:
 *
 *   - which projects changed, versus which were only pulled in by `dependsOn: ["^build"]`
 *   - therefore why an incremental push is ~4.5 minutes rather than ~20
 *   - what the skip actually saved, in tests rather than in the word "skipped"
 *
 * A skipped job also looks identical whether the skip was correct or a bug in the affected
 * computation, and job selection has no equivalent of Nx's `Cache: N/N hit` line to read —
 * which is how a .dockerignore change once shipped unvalidated. So the reasoning is rendered
 * rather than left to be inferred from an absence.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/ci/plan-summary.js <graph.json> <affected.json> <shots.json> <images.json> \
 *        <forced-reason-or-empty> >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
