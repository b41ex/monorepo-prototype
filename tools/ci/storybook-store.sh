# One component's Storybook into the store, for the branch this run is on.
#
# THE STORE is ghcr, `ghcr.io/<owner>/storybook-<component>`, and nothing is committed to any
# branch. Three kinds of tag, each on its OWN manifest:
#
#   out-<hash>     the build: one gzipped tarball of `dist-showcase`, keyed by its OUTPUT, a hash
#                  of its files (storybook-site.js outhash). Two builds with identical files are
#                  stored once, whatever their inputs were
#   in-<hash>      an index keyed by the build's INPUTS, naming the out- content they produced.
#                  It is what lets an unchanged component skip the build entirely
#   branch-<slug>  the pointer pages.yml assembles the site from, naming the out- content
#
# WHY OUTPUT AND NOT ONLY INPUT. The input hash is tools/ci/image-input-hash.sh, the images'
# identity, and it is deliberately coarse: a component rebuilds whenever anything in its
# dependency closure changes. Measured 2026-09-14: retitling one graphapi story moved the input
# hash of api-doc-viewer and ui, which both depend on graphapi, and both rebuilt to the SAME files
# apart from a build timestamp. Keyed by input, that branch published 71.7 MiB; keyed by output,
# 28.3 MiB.
#
# Two inputs needed adding to the hash for Storybook specifically, both carried in storybooks.json:
#
#   ui            the config lives in ui-shared but loads stories from ui-portal and ui-agents
#                 and aliases both packages, so all three trees decide the build
#   apispec-view  packages/elements/.storybook only re-exports the WORKSPACE root's
#                 .storybook, and the Storybook dependencies are declared in the workspace
#                 root package.json. Neither sits inside the elements project
#
# This script and the sourcemap stripper are hash inputs too: they decide what is stored, so a
# change to either must not be served from content produced under the old rules.
#
# POINTERS AND INDEXES ARE NEVER TAGS ON THE CONTENT MANIFEST. Deleting a package version in ghcr
# removes every tag on it, which storybook-probe.yml measured. An alias tag for feature-x would
# mean deleting feature-x deletes the Storybook of every branch sharing its content.
#
# Environment: COMPONENT PROJECT HASH_PROJECTS HASH_PATHS OUTPUT OWNER, plus the GITHUB_* the
# runner provides. Expects `oras` logged in to ghcr.

# `-e` exits without a word, and an `oras` whose stderr is sent to /dev/null leaves the log with

# fire inside functions and command substitutions too.
