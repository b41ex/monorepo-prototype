// `frontendVersion` used to come from `import * as packageJson from
// '../../../../portal/package.json'`, and both halves of that were wrong.
//
// Wrong value: this hook serves BOTH apps. `BasePage.tsx` in agents calls
// `useVersionInfo(agent)` and a shared component calls it with no argument, so the fallback
// reported Portal's version inside Agents. A placeholder that admits it does not know beats
// a number that names the wrong product.
//
// Wrong shape: it made `ui-shared` depend on `ui-portal` while `ui-portal` already depended
// on `ui-shared`, so the Nx project graph held a cycle — visible as a two-headed edge in the
// CI plan diagram, which is how it was found. It cost real time: a change to Portal alone
// marked ui-shared AND ui-agents affected, and with the edge removed it marks neither. There
// was no build-order failure only because ui-shared has no `build` script, just
// `build:showcase`; the day it gains one, `dependsOn: ["^build"]` becomes a circular task
// dependency and Nx refuses to run.
//
// This file is also what shared's own .eslintrc.json exists to prevent — it bans
// `@b41ex/qubership-apihub-ui-portal` and `…/*` by name. A relative path matched neither
// pattern, so the rule was aimed at the spelling rather than at the boundary. It now covers
// the traversal form too.
//
// The real values are not affected: they come from the version.json that
// frontend/ui/vite-create-version-json.ts generates per app, fetched by the query below.
// This constant is only what is shown before that resolves.
