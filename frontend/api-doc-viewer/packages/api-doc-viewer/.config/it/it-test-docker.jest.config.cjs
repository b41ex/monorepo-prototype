    // `screenshot-test` is cacheable, and its hash covers {projectRoot}/**/* — which includes
    // this file. So bumping 1.9.0 to a new version busts the cache automatically, which is
    // exactly what should happen. A TAG does not give that guarantee: ghcr tags are mutable,
    // and a re-push of 1.9.0 would change the browser under the tests without changing a byte
    // Nx can see, leaving a cached pass standing for an environment that no longer exists.
    //
    // The tag is kept alongside the digest for readability. Docker resolves by digest and
    // ignores the tag; the image string is passed verbatim to `docker run` (see
    // tools/jest-chrome-in-docker-environment/src/lib/core/docker-chrome.ts), so nothing
    // parses or splits it. Digest verified against ghcr: :1.9.0 and this digest return a
    // byte-identical manifest.
    //
    // To move to a new image: change the tag AND the digest together. They are one fact.
