 * `SPEC_TYPE_DDL_API_1` by the Realm shape), then attribute each diff to its owning table's
 * `ddlEntityId` by walking the merged Realm.
 *
 * Attribution relies on api-diff's `aggregateDiffsWithRollup`, which rolls every diff under a table
 * (columns, indexes, FKs, comments, table attrs) up onto the table node's `DIFFS_AGGREGATED_META_KEY`
 * **Set** — and, crucially, fans a **shared schema-level type** change (enum/domain/…) onto every table
 * whose column references it (D2: the per-table aggregation is automatic via the column→type reference;
 * a type referenced by no table never reaches a table node, so orphan-type diffs yield nothing). An
 * added/removed whole table is a single diff on the parent `tables[]` array's `DIFF_META_KEY`.
