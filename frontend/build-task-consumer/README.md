# qubership-apihub-build-task-consumer

Node.js microservice for APIHUB Package versions builds.

This microservice is REST API and task management wrapper for [qubership-apihub-api-processor](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-apihub-api-processor) library.

Delievered as a Docker image and included into Qubership-APIHUB delivery as a mandatory part.

So please refer to [qubership-apihub](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-apihub) application repository for end-to-end installation details.

## Installation

Not from here, and not with npm. This component is a member of the pnpm workspace, so it has
no install of its own — dependencies are resolved once, at the workspace root, from the single
`pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
pnpm install          # at the workspace root, not in this directory
```

Running `npm install` here would write a `package-lock.json` and a flat `node_modules` beside
this manifest, resolve the `workspace:` specifiers against the registry rather than the sibling
packages, and give this component a second, disagreeing set of versions. That is the shape the
monorepo exists to remove.

## Building the app locally

No `.npmrc` and no GitHub PAT are needed any more. Nothing is fetched from a registry at
image-build time; the image is assembled from output you have already built.

```bash
pnpm install                                    # once, at the workspace root
pnpm exec nx build build-task-consumer
pnpm deploy --filter=./frontend/build-task-consumer --prod \
            frontend/build-task-consumer/.deploy
cd frontend/build-task-consumer && podman build -f Dockerfile.local .
```

The `pnpm deploy` step is the one prerequisite and it cannot be dropped. This image used to
run `npm ci` inside itself against a per-component `npm-shrinkwrap.json`; the workspace has
one lockfile at the root, that shrinkwrap is gone, and the internal dependencies are
`workspace:` specifiers that no in-image install can resolve. `pnpm deploy --prod` produces a
production-only tree with those specifiers already resolved, and it has to run where the
workspace is. See the header of `Dockerfile.local` for why it is not simply moved inside the
image — briefly: it would restore the QEMU-emulated install that made this the slowest image
by a factor of three.

**On Windows** `pnpm deploy` may fail with `EPERM` renaming its temporary directory into
place — a handle held over the thousands of files just written, usually a virus scanner. It is
reliable on Linux. Build this image in CI or WSL if that happens.

### Production Docker image (locally)

The production `Dockerfile` takes the **workspace root** as its context and needs no build
secret, because it pulls nothing from a registry:

```bash
pnpm exec nx build build-task-consumer
pnpm deploy --filter=./frontend/build-task-consumer --prod .deploy/build-task-consumer
podman build -f frontend/build-task-consumer/Dockerfile .     # from the workspace root
```

That is the command CI runs. `Dockerfile.local` exists because the same build from this
directory is shorter and has no workspace-root paths in it; the two differ only in where the
inputs come from.

## Running the app

`pnpm run`, not `npm run` — and this is not a spelling preference. Under
`nodeLinker: isolated` a script that shells out to `npm` gets npm's flat resolution instead of
pnpm's, and npm also reads the workspace's pnpm settings and warns about every one it does not
recognise. `tools/migration/rewrite-scripts.js` rewrote the whole fleet's scripts for this
reason; the prose here was missed.

Two of the three lines were also not valid npm in the first place — `npm start:dev` is not a
command; it would have to be `npm run start:dev`. Only `start` may be run bare, and pnpm
accepts all three the same way.

```bash
# development
$ pnpm start

# watch mode
$ pnpm start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm start:prod
```

## Which image tag CI publishes

The branch decides the floating tag; the content decides the immutable one.

| branch | floating tag |
|---|---|
| `develop` | `:dev` |
| `release` | `:next` |
| `main` | `:latest` |

Every build pushes `:src-<hash>`, derived from the git tree hashes of this project and its
transitive dependencies plus the Dockerfile, `.dockerignore` and the lockfile. That is the only
tag a build writes. The floating tag is applied afterwards as an alias of it, on every run,
whether or not anything was built — so a build whose `src-` tag already exists is skipped and
costs about a second.

The image jobs are not gated on `nx affected`. Whether a floating tag points at the right image
is a fact about the registry, and `affected` only knows what changed between two commits, so a
branch on which nothing changed would otherwise keep a stale pointer forever.

## Where the provenance lives

Not in the image. `GIT_BRANCH` and `GIT_HASH` used to be baked in as environment variables and
were removed, because a ref is not a property of the content. Two branches at one commit hash
identically, so they share a `src-` tag, and the branch tag is published by retagging rather
than rebuilding — which meant the image serving `:dev` reported `GIT_BRANCH=main`.

The ref and commit are now OCI annotations on the index that each branch tag points at, which
is per-tag and can therefore be true for every tag at once:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/b41ex/apihub-build-task-consumer:dev
```

`org.opencontainers.image.version` is the ref and `org.opencontainers.image.revision` the
commit. The trade is that `echo $GIT_BRANCH` inside a running container no longer answers the
question; the command above does, and it answers for the tag you actually pulled.
